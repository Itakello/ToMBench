## Hola! Welcome to the official repository for **ToMBench**! üéâ



ToMBench is a systematic, automated, and original bilingual Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmark for LLMs, containing 2,860 testing samples involving diverse real-world social scenarios.

‚úÖ The inventory of ToMBench can be found in `ToMBench_release_v1_0618.xlsx`. 

‚úÖ Evaluation prompts can be found in `Table 20` of our paper.



## Important Notice ‚ö†Ô∏è
Before using ToMBench, please note:
**Use ToMBench for evaluation purposes only. Avoid using ToMBench data for training in any circumstance to prevent data contamination, which can lead to inflated performance.**

## Theory-of-Mind Tasks
ToMBench covers 8 theory-of-mind tasks:
- **Unexpected Outcome Test:** Evaluating the ability to infer characters' mental states in scenarios with discrepancies between expected and actual emotions.
- **Scalar Implicature Task:** Involving scenarios where a speaker uses terms like "some" to imply "not all," testing the ability to infer meanings beyond literal expressions.
- **Persuasion Story Task:** Assessing the ability to understand and choose effective persuasion strategies, reflecting an understanding of how to influence others' mental states.
- **False Belief Task:** Examining the ability to distinguish between one's own beliefs (true beliefs) and others' beliefs (false beliefs).
- **Ambiguous Story Task:** Presenting ambiguous social vignettes to gauge understanding of others' mental states in uncertain situations.
- **Hinting Test:** Assessing the ability to infer mental states from indirect hints in social interactions.
- **Strange Story Task:** Requiring inferring characters' mental states in stories with complex social communications like lies, misunderstandings, irony, and jokes.
- **Faux-pas Recognition Test:** Testing the ability to recognize social faux pas, reflecting an understanding of social norms and others' perspectives.

## Theory-of-Mind Abilities
ToMBench covers 6 theory-of-mind ability categories and 31 specific theory-of-mind abilities from the ATOMS framework:

### Emotion üòä
This category involves understanding situational influences on emotions, complex emotions, and emotional regulation. It includes 7 abilities:
1. **Typical Emotional Reactions:** Inferring emotional reactions based on typical situations.
2. **Atypical Emotional Reactions:** Inferring or explaining emotional reactions based on atypical situations.
